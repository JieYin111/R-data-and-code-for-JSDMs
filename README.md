# The Joint Species Distribution Model
This GitHub repository contains data and R code for implementing a Joint Species Distribution Model (JSDM) to analyze fish community distributions in the central and southern Yellow Sea, China.

A full description of the model framework, data sources, and analytical approach can be found in:
Zhang et al. (2025).

This repository includes:
- `study_data.RData`: processed input data used for model fitting, including environmental variables and species data.
- `Rcode.R`: R scripts used to run the JSDM, perform model fitting, and generate results and figures reported in the manuscript.
